# Cats Flutter

This repository is an open-source project to learn flutter testing. 

## First part

I have created a randomize visualizer of cats using https://thecatapi.com/ to get the cats.
Tested parts:

- Unit testing to repository and service class.
- Bloc testing 
- Widget testing.

## Second part

The idea is to use the same api to do a page with a random cat list and have a navigation to a detail page. 
Tests to do:

- Unit testing
- Bloc testing
- Widget testing

If you want to participate in this part feel free to do it, open a new PR :) 

## Third part

The idea is to have a profile page with some options to enable/disable, for example, use dark or light theme, add some animation to test it and more.
Tests to do:

- Unit testing
- Bloc testing
- Widget testing

If you want to participate in this part feel free to do it, open a new PR :)
