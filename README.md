# Cats Flutter

This repository is an open-source project to learn flutter testing. 🧪

## Project

I have created a randomize visualizer of cats using https://thecatapi.com/ to get the cats.

Tested parts:

- Unit testing to repository and service class.
- Bloc testing 
- Widget testing.
- Integration test.


If you want to participate in this part feel free to do it, open a new PR 😊
